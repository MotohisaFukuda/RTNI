The following files are included:

* [IHU_source.py](IHU_source.py) - main python file for the RTNI package
* [WFG_source.py](WFG_source.py) - python file for the precomputation of Weingarten functions
* [example_WFG.py](example_WFG.py) - example file for the usage of WFG_source.py
* [Weingarten/pkl2text.py](Weingarten/pkl2text.py) - program for conversion of pkl files to txt 

In addition, precomputed Weingarten functions are provided in the subdirectory [Weingarten](Weingarten).
